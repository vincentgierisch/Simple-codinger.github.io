title: Hello you!
---

Hello and good morning, good afternoon and good evening to you, the wonderful people of the internet! 
(Actually I've stolen this sentence from the even more wonderful Dave Simpson).

My name is Vince and I am a computer engineering student. I love to play around with technology stuff and I would like to 
show you some things that I created. 

So basically this blog is all about hardware (especially IoT) and software.
If you want further information, take a look at my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/Simple-codinger).

So brace yourself, technology stuff is coming.

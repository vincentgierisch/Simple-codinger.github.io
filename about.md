I'm a computer science student who loves learning new things. 
I'm excited to share my knowledge with you and teach you about interesting topics. 
Together, we'll explore complex subjects in a simple and fun way.

I already have a pretty long list of topics and projects I want to talk about. 
But if you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me.
